| Running the example |
+---------------------+
Simply copy the pre-built application archive (mule-example-hello.zip) to the 
application folder ($MULE_HOME/apps) and start Mule. When Mule is running go to 
your browser to run it:

    http://localhost:8888/?name=Ross

You can change 'Ross' to any string you want.

| Building the example |
+----------------------+
You can build the example by simply running "ant" or "mvn".  This will compile 
the example classes, produce an application zip file and copy it to 
$MULE_HOME/apps.
