            <p>
                Synapse requires Java 1.5 or higher and has been tested on Java runtime environments
                from Sun, IBM and Apple. Note that the recommended Java version is 1.6. Synapse is
                used on various operation systems, including Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, Windows and AIX,
                as well as mainframe environments. The recommended operation system for production use
                is Linux since it offers a wider range of options to tune the TCP/IP stack. This is
                important to optimize the performance of the NIO HTTP transport.
            </p>
            <p>
                When selecting the environment for deployment, the following known issues should be taken into account:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <tt>synapse.bat</tt> and <tt>synapse.sh</tt> scripts included in the binary
                    distribution use the <tt>-server</tt> option which is not supported by IBM's JRE.
                    This problem can be easily solved by manually editing these scripts to
                    remove the unsupported <tt>-server</tt> option. See
                    <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYNAPSE-454">SYNAPSE-454</a>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the past several issues related to subtle concurrency problems have been reported
                    with the non-blocking HTTP transport (which is the recommended HTTP implementation
                    for Synapse) when used on more &quot;exotic&quot; platforms. While this has been
                    improved it is recommended to thoroughly test the HTTP transport before deploying
                    Synapse in a production environment based on these platforms. Please don't hesitate
                    to report any issues using JIRA or by posting a message on the mailing list.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <a name="Overview_of_available_deployment_options"></a><div class="section"><h2 id="Overview_of_available_deployment_options">Overview of available deployment options</h2>

            <p>Synapse can be deployed in two different ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stand-alone, i.e. as an independently managed Java process.</li>
                <li>
                    As a J2EE application (WAR) deployed into a simple servlet container (e.g. Tomcat)
                    or a full-featured J2EE application server.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Since Synapse doesn't rely on any container API, the features offered are the same in
                both deployment scenarios, with very few exceptions:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    There is a minor issue that prevents classpath resources from being used in a
                    WAR deployment. See <a class="externalLink" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SYNAPSE-207">SYNAPSE-207</a>
                    .
                </li>
                <li>
                    When deployed as a WAR file, Synapse can be configured with the standard Axis2
                    servlet based HTTP transport: while the recommended HTTP implementation for Synapse
                    is the NIO HTTP transport, there might be situations where it is preferable or
                    mandatory to use the HTTP protocol implementation of the application server.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In some scenarios Synapse is used to proxy services that are deployed themselves on
                an application server. In these cases it would be interesting to deploy Synapse on
                the same application server and use an in-VM transport instead of HTTP to communicate
                with these services. Note that for the moment no production-grade implementation of
                this type of transport exists yet for Axis2, but this might change in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the features offered are almost the same, the differences between the two
                deployment options are mainly related to packaging and operational considerations:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many IT departments prefer deploying J2EE applications than managing stand-alone
                    Java processes, because this allows them to leverage the management and monitoring
                    facilities offered by the application server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the use case relies on JNDI resources such as JMS connection factories,
                    JDBC data source and transactions it might be easier to set up and configure these
                    resources when Synapse is deployed directly on the application
                    server that hosts these resources.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <p>
                    The easiest way to get started with a stand-alone deployment is using the standard
                    binary distribution ZIP or tarball (see <a href="download.html">download.html</a>).
                    It already contains everything that is needed to run Synapse stand-alone and you
                    only need to customize it according to your requirements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Place your mediation configuration in <tt>repository/conf/synapse-config</tt>
                        directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place any additional files such as WSDL files, endpoint definitions, etc.

                <p>
                    Since the standard binary distribution also contains samples and documentation,
                    you might want to remove the following folders:

                <ul>

                <p>
                    The <tt>bin</tt> directory contains Unix and Windows scripts to run Synapse:

                    <li>
                        <tt>synapse.sh</tt> and <tt>synapse.bat</tt> allow to run Synapse in non
                        daemon mode.

                    <li>
                        <tt>synapse-daemon.sh</tt> is a Sys V init script that can be used on Unix

                <p>
                    Building a custom Synapse package based on the standard binary distribution is a
                    manual process and this has some drawbacks:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The JAR files required to run Synapse must be selected manually and it is not easy to identify unused JARs
                        that could be safely removed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The process is not suitable if there is a requirement for strict configuration management. In particular:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Because of the large number of JAR files, managing the artifacts using
                                a source control repository is not practical.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The process is not repeatable and there is no way to go back to a
                                previous version of the artifacts.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When upgrading to a newer version of Synapse (or when working with snapshot
                        versions), it is necessary either to manually replace the JARs in the current
                        package or to start again from a new version of the standard binary
                        distribution.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If Synapse needs to be deployed with slightly different configurations in
                        multiple environments (e.g. test and production), the corresponding packages
                        need to be prepared manually.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note that these problems not only arise in the development and maintenance phases
                    of a project, but also when doing proof of concepts that you want to keep in a safe
                    place for later reuse. One approach to overcome these difficulties is to use Maven
                    to assemble a custom package. When used correctly, this approach solves all of the
                    issues identified above. In particular Maven's dependency management together with
                    the excellent <a class="externalLink" href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/">assembly plugin</a>
                    can be used to automatically select the relevant JARs to include and pull them
                    from Maven repositories. The remaining artifacts required to assemble the package
                    can then be easily stored in a source control repository.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Synapse provides a Maven archetype that allows to set up this kind of project in
                    only a few simple steps. To begin with, change to the directory where you want to
                    create the project and issue the following command:
                </p>
                <div class="command">mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://synapse.apache.org</div>
                <p>
                    In case of problems, you can try to use the latest version of the archetype catalog:
                </p>
                <div class="command">mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/synapse/trunk/java/src/site/resources</div>
                <p>
                    Finally, if you have build Synapse from sources, you don't need to specify a
                    catalog at all: the archetype is added automatically to the local catalog during
                    the build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In any case, when prompted by Maven, select <tt>synapse-package-archetype</tt>
                    for the Synapse version you want to use. In the next step enter the values for
                    <tt>groupId</tt>, <tt>artifactId</tt> and <tt>version</tt> for your project. You
                    will also be prompted for a package name. Since the archetype doesn't contain any source
                    code, this value is irrelevant and you can continue with the default value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this stage a Maven project has been created in a sub-directory with the same
                    name as the <tt>artifactId</tt> specified previously. You should now customize this
                    projects according to your needs:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Add your mediation configuration to <tt>repository/conf/synapse-config</tt>
                        directory.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Customize the dependencies in <tt>pom.xml</tt>. In particular if additional
                        transports such as JMS are needed, add the required dependencies here. Additional
                        Axis2 modules should also be added here.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Enable and configure additional transports in <tt>repository/conf/axis2.xml</tt>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Place any other files referenced by mediation configuration into the
                        <tt>repository</tt> directory.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The project is built as usual with the following command:
                </p>
                <div class="command">mvn package</div>
                <p>
                    This will create a ZIP file (in the <tt>target</tt> directory) containing
                    everything that is needed to run your custom Synapse configuration. You only
                    need to extract it and use the appropriate script in the <tt>bin</tt>
                    directory to start Synapse.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <a name="WAR_deployment"></a><div class="section"><h2 id="WAR_deployment">WAR deployment</h2>
            <p>
                Synapse provides a standard WAR file that can be used to deploy mediation on a servlet
                container or on a J2EE application server. Note that this WAR file is not part of the
                downloadable distributions. It can be retrieved from the following location:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a class="externalLink" href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/synapse/synapse-war/">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/synapse/synapse-war/</a>
                    for released versions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a class="externalLink" href="http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Synapse%20-%20Trunk/org.apache.synapse$synapse-war/">http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Synapse%20-%20Trunk/org.apache.synapse$synapse-war/
                    </a>
                    for snapshot versions.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Customization of the Web application is similar to the stand-alone option, but the
                default directory structure is different:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <tt>synapse.xml</tt> and <tt>axis2.xml</tt> are placed into the <tt>WEB-INF/conf</tt>
                    directory. All other files referenced by your mediation should go to the
                    <tt>WEB-INF/repository</tt>
                    directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Additional libraries must be placed into the standard <tt>WEB-INF/lib</tt>
                    directory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Axis2 modules are located in <tt>repository/modules</tt>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <tt>log4j.properties</tt> is located in <tt>WEB-INF/classes</tt>.
                </li>
            </ul>
